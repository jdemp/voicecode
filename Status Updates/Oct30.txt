On monday I was able to get dragon dictate sending the text to the program. This took much longer than expected due to
a issue with Dragon's applescript editor, using smart quotes thus preventing the applescript from compiling.

The program can now format the first line of basic classes and functions, following the pep8 style guide.

My current issue is determining the logic needed to handle certain structures such as for loops, methods that take parameters,
function calls, and math operators. I hope to figure this out this weekend, I will probably end up making parsers that handle
specific things and allowing the create functions to pass parts of the dictation to these parsers.

Next week I hope to have the program able to handle for loops, while loops, function calls and basic math.
