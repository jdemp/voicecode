Assignment #5
-------------

Summary:
-------
Write a program that counts the number of occurrances of all of the vowels in
a sentence entered by a user.  The program should print the number of occurances 
of each vowel.

Below is an example of what the sample run should look like if the user enters
the sentence, "This is a test"

Please enter a sentence: This is a test

Sentence: This is a test
The letter a was found 1 times
The letter e was found 2 times
The letter i was found 2 times
The letter o was found 0 times
The letter u was found 0 times

Hints:
------
1) After the user enters the sentence, make all of the characters in the 
sentence lower case so that you don't have to check for upper and lower
case of each letter.

2) I suggest you write a letter counting function that takes two parameters.
The first parameter should be the letter to search for.  The second parameter
should be the sentence.  The function should return the letter count.  Call
the function for each vowel.

3) Suggest you use a for loop with 'in' to search for occurances of the letter.
example: 

for letter in sentence :
