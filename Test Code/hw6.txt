For this problem, start with the following list of words:

teams = ["Orioles", "Red Sox", "Rangers", "Indians", "Tigers", "Astros", "Royals", "Angels"]

Part 1
------
Write a program that maps the teams list of words to a different list of integers 
representing the lengths of the corresponding words. Use a for-loop.  
Print each item in the teams list and the corresponding string length from the list of integers.
Your list of string lengths must be stored in a separate list from the teams list.

Part 2
------
Replace "Red Sox" with "Mets", using a list method, recalculate the list of integer lengths 
and reprint the teams list and the corresponding lengths.

Part 3
------
Pop "Angels" off the list and append "Marlins".  
Recalculate the lengths and reprint the teams and lengths.
